## üìÅ File Naming Convention

Make sure your JSON files are named exactly like this:

- `Map_Noclateo.json`
- `Boss_Adel.json`
- `Character_Wylder.json`

> ‚úÖ First letter must be capitalized  
> ‚úÖ File must be in the same directory as the script  
> ‚ùå Do not include file extensions in parameter values


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open **PowerShell** in the folder containing the script and JSON files.

2. Run the script with the required parameters:

   ```powershell
   powershell -File .\merger.ps1 -map $map -boss $boss -character $character
   ```

3. Output:

   ```
   ‚úÖ Merged JSON written to Merged_Map-<Map>_Boss-<Boss>_Character-<Character>.json
   ```
